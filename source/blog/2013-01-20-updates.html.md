Thanks to a question from a reader [^fn1], I revisited the posts about creating EC2 instances on Amazon AWS:

* [Getting Started with Amazon EC2](http://craigcottingham.github.com/2011/03/15/ec2-getting-started.html)
* [Baby's First Amazon EC2 Instance](http://craigcottingham.github.com/2011/03/16/babys-first-ec2-instance.html)
* [Persistent Servers with Amazon EC2 and EBS](http://craigcottingham.github.com/2011/03/17/ec2-ebs-instance.html)

Fortunately, they didn't need too much updating. The procedure for setting up your AWS and EC2 credentials
seems to have changed a little, and I also updated the AMI references to more recent 64 bit images.

[^fn1]: Probably the only one, and I'm pretty sure he found me through Google.
