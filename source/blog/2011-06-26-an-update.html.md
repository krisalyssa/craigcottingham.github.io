I realized some time after posting
[Cooking up EC2 Instances with Chef](/2011/06/09/cooking-up-ec2-instances-with-chef.html)
that I had described the internal structure of `cookbooks.tar.gz` incorrectly. The top-level directory
containing the cookbooks should be called `cookbooks`, not `recipes`. We regret the error.
