# About me

I'm a professional nerd from the Midwest with more than 20 years experience developing
software, some of which is actually useful to others. Trained in chemical engineering,
I chose not to pursue that professionally, but instead do what I love: drink beer and
rearrange characters on this glowing rectangle on my desk.
